# My 1st Project in The Odin Project

## What's the project about?
- It's some recipes that I like (5 of them);
- The project was made 100% in pure HTML;

## Some things from the project that were used in this "Recipe Book"
- Heading elements:
    I've tried to use the heading elements, and their respective hierarchy to do the project's body;
- Paragraphs:
    All HTML file from this project has paragraphs filled with the topic's information;
- Links and Images:
    Almost all the recipes have an image for each step;
    In the file index.html, I used a lot of anchor tag (<a>) to link the homepage with the recipes page;
- Lists:
    All the recipes has a minimum 2 types of lists each, being them:
        ordened lists (<ol>);
        unordened lists (<ul>);
